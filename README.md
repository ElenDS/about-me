About Me
======================
Hi! I'm Lena and I study at Hillel school. It is a great oppoturnity for me because javascript is what I always wanted to learn!
I worked in a small team of web developers for several years. My job was to create simple websites but I want more.
I hope my studies will be successful.
Thank you for this chance!
